            I have a simple blog that contains my learning experiences and short articles
            about web programming, including HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS.
            I created this blog as a learning practice and as a place to document my progress
            in understanding web development.

            Through this blog, I hope to continuously improve my skills, especially in
            writing and sharing knowledge related to technology and programming.

            My Coding Learning Experience
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            At the beginning, learning coding felt difficult and confusing.
            However, with regular practice and consistency, I gradually started to
            understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS.

            Building simple projects such as a CV website and a personal blog helped me
            gain more confidence and motivation to keep learning and improving my skills.
